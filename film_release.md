# TrustOS Film Release — YouTube & GitHub Assets

## YouTube Title
```
I Built an ENTIRE OS From Scratch. 120,000 Lines. ONE Person. Zero C.
```

## YouTube Description
```
What if you could understand every single line of your operating system?

TrustOS is a fully auditable, bare-metal OS written in 120,000 lines of pure Rust — by a single developer. No C. No libraries. No secrets.

In this film:
• ACT I — You use a computer every day, but do you know what it really does?
• ACT II — 50 million lines of code. Nobody knows what's inside.
• ACT III — What if one person could understand ALL of it?
• ACT IV — Watch a real packet travel through a handmade network stack
• ACT V — Computing is not magic. TrustOS proves it.

What's inside TrustOS:
🔧 Full TCP/IP + DNS + HTTP + DHCP network stack
🔒 TLS 1.3, Ed25519, SHA-256 cryptography
💻 TrustLang — a complete programming language & compiler
🖥️ COSMIC2 Desktop with windows, themes, animations
🌐 TrustBrowser — HTTP + HTML renderer in the kernel
🎮 Snake, Tetris, Pong, Chess 3D
📹 Built-in video codec
📝 TrustCode — Full code editor
🗂️ FAT32 filesystem with persistence
